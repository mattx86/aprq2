== Overview ==

AprQ2 installation is fairly straightforward.  Type 'make' to build the game.
Feel free to edit Makefile to meet your needs, but do so at your own peril.
By default, the binaries will be built to the 'releasei386' directory.  Copy
them to an appropriate path (e.g. ~/.quake2, /usr/share/games/quake2, etc).

== Dependencies ==

This version of AprQ2 should compile cleanly on recent Linux distributions and
on Apple OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard).  For Linux, you should install libSDL and
libCURL via your package manager.  For OS X, you should install libSDL and 
libCURL through MacPorts.

If you get stuck installing dependencies, try the instructions for your
platform here:

== Installation ==

1. Create your Quake2 directory.
  mkdir -p ~/.quake2/baseq2
  
2. Install the Quake2 game data
  cp /path/to/pak*.pak ~/.quake2/baseq2
  
3. Compile AprQ2
  cd /path/to/aprq2
  make -j2

4. Install the binaries
  cp releasei386/aq2 ~/.quake2
  cp releasei386/gamei386.so ~/.quake2/baseq2
  
5. Install the optional game data (recommended)
  cp -r baseq2/pics ~/.quake2/baseq2

6. Start the game
  cd ~/.quake2
  ./aq2
  
== High-resolution textures ==

R1CH (http://r1ch.net) provides an excellent high-color, high-resolution
texture "pak" that looks fantastic in AprQ2.  You can download the "pak" file
here:

  http://r-1.ch/z6_32bitclr_png_allmaps.7z

To install it, simply extract the archive and move the included .pak file to
your Quake2 directory, and rename it to pak9.pak:

  cd /tmp
  wget http://r-1.ch/z6_32bitclr_png_allmaps.7z
  cd ~/.quake2/baseq2
  7z e /tmp/z6_32bitclr_png_allmaps.7z
  mv z*.pak pak9.pak
